# leaflet-challenge

In this assignment, I used javascript and Leaflet to visualize an earthquake dataset from USGS. All of the earthquakes from the last 7 days are shown on the map at their respective lat/long points. I added data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color. Included are popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clickedas well as a legend to help provide context.


Additionally, I plotted a second dataset on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data used for tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates. The tectonic plates dataset is plotted on the map in addition to the earthquakes but each dataset is in a separate overlay that can be turned on and off independently. Screenshots of the final page are below.
